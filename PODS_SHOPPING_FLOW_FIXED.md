## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

### **The Problem**
The `pepperPods` category was missing the `sizes` property in the product configuration, while `plants` had it. The size selection modal was looking for `products[selectedCategory]?.sizes` but finding `undefined` for pods.

### **Data Structure Issue**
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE (Broken)
pepperPods: {
  categoryName: 'Fresh Pepper Pods',
  categoryIcon: '🌶️',
  varieties: plantVarieties,
  // ❌ Missing 'sizes' property!
  products: []
}

// ✅ AFTER (Fixed)
pepperPods: {
  categoryName: 'Fresh Pepper Pods',
  categoryIcon: '🌶️',
  varieties: plantVarieties,
  sizes: [                    // ✅ Added sizes!
    {
      id: 'small-pod',
      name: 'Small (1/4 lb)',
      description: 'Perfect for trying new varieties',
      price: 8.00,
      weight: '0.25 lbs'
    },
    // ... more sizes
  ],
  products: []
}
```

## 🛠️ **Complete Fix Implementation**

### **1. Added Pod Size Options**
```javascript
sizes: [
  {
    id: 'small-pod',
    name: 'Small (1/4 lb)',
    description: 'Perfect for trying new varieties',
    price: 8.00,
    weight: '0.25 lbs'
  },
  {
    id: 'medium-pod',
    name: 'Medium (1/2 lb)',
    description: 'Great for cooking and recipes',
    price: 15.00,
    weight: '0.5 lbs'
  },
  {
    id: 'large-pod',
    name: 'Large (1 lb)',
    description: 'Bulk quantity for serious cooks',
    price: 25.00,
    weight: '1 lb'
  }
]
```

### **2. Enhanced Size Modal for Pods**
```javascript
// Display weight information for pod sizes
{selectedCategory === 'pepperPods' && size.weight && (
  <div className="text-red-400 text-xs mt-1">
    {size.weight}
  </div>
)}
```

### **3. Dynamic Pricing Display**
```javascript
// Category card shows live pricing
<div className="text-sm text-gray-400">
  Starting at ${products.pepperPods?.sizes?.[0]?.price?.toFixed(2) || '8.00'}
</div>
```
